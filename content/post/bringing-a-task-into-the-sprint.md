## Introduction
Bringing a new ticket into a sprint is a question that can be very common. Certain things will make it more or less likely, including things like shifting priorities, surprise deadlines or unclear requirements. But not every reason for bringing in a new ticket is bad - maybe we simply finished all the other tickets in the sprint! (Hopefully not because our estimates were way off, or because our sprint planning was too pessimistic.)

## Can we bring in the task?

Is there a ticket (PBI) for the task?
Are there unmet dependencies?
What are the risks?
Does it fit within the sprint?
Does the task meet the other DoR?

## Should we bring in the task?

Are there enough days left to do it or will we have to drop something? What will we drop?
What are the benefits and risks of bringing this in? What are the benefits and risks of not?
Is the PO happy that its the right priority choice to do this ticket over any other ready ticket?
